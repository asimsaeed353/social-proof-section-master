## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the approach to design layouts like this. I learned to always start with simple things and the add the complexities gradually to the design.

I tried designing layout for desktop first and then making it responsive for smaller devices, but it was not a good apporach. Then I shifted to mobile first workflow, took things simple and then made the design responsive for the large screen devices.
